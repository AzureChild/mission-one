                That said, Mekk-Knights are an archetype from the Yu-Gi-Oh Trading Card Game. In today's
                meta they are definitely overlooked due to power creep but they still retain some
                powerful and unique abilities that allow them to compete at a rogue level and can even
                surprise and defeat stronger archetypes through shock value and unfamiliarity.
            </p><br>
            <p>Their archetypal effect gives inherent summoning from hand and their access to an in-engine,
                 searchable Emergency Teleport gives them a limited ability to swarm the field with high attack monsters. 
                 This is bolstered with some strong, in-engine backrow support in cards like 'World Legacy's Secret'
                 and 'World Legacy Key'. Combined with their column mechanics the result is a fun and unique
                 mid-range strategy that has multiple options for Normal Summoning and playing Second.

                <dt>Purple Nightfall x3</dt>
                <dd>The backbone of any Mekk-Knight strategy and arguably our best starter. It searches the rest
                    of our Mekk-Knights to start combos, in a pinch it can banish another Mekk-Knight to protect it
                    and it returns in every standby phase to a column of our choice to continue gaining advantage
                    or can be used in conjunction with our backrow to ensure columns are locked down during our turn
                    if the opponent still has board presence. When searching Blue Sky it also self-clears itself
                    from the column to continue plays. In some circumstances it can also be used for Rank 8 plays
                    with another Nightfall or with Eclipse. Highly recommended to play at 3 copies.
                </dd>

                <dt>Blue Sky x2-3</dt>
                <dd>
                    Nightfall's best friend and a common search target but also a perfectly fine starter card. Blue
                    Sky can search Nightfall when needed or get any other name (usually Girsu) for extension. The
                    downsides are that it cannot clear its own column and requires an opponents card to get searches.
                    This card is one of the best reasons to choose to go second with a Mekk-Knight Strategy. 2 copies
                    is fine as it is a weaker opener - especially for mixed engines but 3 will help maintain consistency.
                </dd>

                <dt>Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight x1-2</dt>
                <dd>
                    Arguably our best Normal Summon, he is unfortunately still stuck in semi-limited prison. Despite
                    that, you may want to keep it at 1 or 2 copies anyway. Girsu does a lot - sending World Legacy cards
                    to enable Keymaster lines and acting as his own extender whilst setting up columns for other Mekk-Knights
                    to summon into. With a bit of deckbuilding he can even operate as a one card Zeus. However outside of this
                    opening just Girsu is not exactly full combo, which is why it is best searched off of Nightfall. The fact
                    he is a normal summonable Mekk-Knight also cannot be overlooked as sometimes column space is at a premium.
                    
                    Any hand containing 2 of these 3 above cards is one of the strongest in-engine openers we have and typically
                    will end on I.P Masquerena plus Keymaster.
